## House Don Luis

This essay explores the creation of a free Black town in the early Spanish empire. Don Luis Mozambique was the leader of a group of fifty-five <i>negros cimarrones</i>, or maroons in English sources. 
I will call this interrelated group of men, women, and children "House Don Luis"

## Tierra Firme in the 16th Century
The Spanish called this section of their mainland Caribbean colonies "Tierra Firme," meaning "Solid Ground." The isthmus of Panama was a critical crossing point between the Atlantic and Pacific for goods, information, and people. How did that work?

## What's in a name?

How much can these names tell us? 
This element is an image now as a placeholder. Might be a better demonstration of the capacity to use a map element with geo-json layers.
