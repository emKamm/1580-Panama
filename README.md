1. [[TierraFirme1]] Map of palenques, I am adding to this map
	1. Talk about Figueroa map
	2. Zoom in to Isthmus, talk about what should be added to it
	3. There are many stories yet to add. I am starting with Santiago del Principe.
2. [[TierraFirme2]]Where did Marronage happen? Why there?
	1. Interior mountains
	2. Dense forests
	3. Alongside trade routes
3. [[TierraFirme3]] What was the isthmus of Panama like (geography, demography)
4.  [[TierraFirme4]] Where did colonial "control" circulate in the late sixteenth century
	1. 	On the sea, on the carerra da indias
		1. How is the isthmus a central link on the carerra?
	2. In Spanish cities
	3. Factories: on west African coast, on Brazilian Atlantic coast, in Andes, in Sierra Madre, in Caribbean mainland ports, in Havana. 
5. [[TierraFirme5]] How did the colonial world function in those spaces
	1.  On the sea, where guys who have high ambitions but aren't high born circulate (I don't know what I meant by that?)
		1.  Some of these guys are spanish, some are french or english, privateers are the non state entities trying to nibble off the edges of the wealth being produced by the Spanish empire in the silver mines, the pearl islands, the Asian porcelain, etc.
	2.  Within the cities lives the structured, legal world of the spanish vecinos. How does the legal world work there?  
	3.  And within those spanish colonial cities: How does the material world work? How is food produced, how is labor performed? 
6. [[TierraFirme6]]  Whose labor made it possible? Enslaved Africans. 
7.  [[TierraFirme7]]  Who are [[House Don Luis]]?
8. [[TierraFirme8]]  How did they fit into the landscape of options before recognition? 
	1. Creating chaos, undermining Spanish control and possibly more.
9.  [[TierraFirme9]]  How did they fit into their new freedom landscape?
	1. Self-creating social forms, control shifting into new hands.
10. [[TierraFirme10]]  Which options created freedom (flight, fight, pledge, submit, disperse...)?
11. [[which-history-Panama]]  Why does it matter to go even further back into the African past of the Americas?
12. [[what-next-Panama]]  What else? What next? Talk about who else is doing this work, what it connects to, where my engagement with it goes next. 




## House Don Luis

This essay explores the creation of a free Black town in the early Spanish empire. Don Luis Mozambique was the leader of a group of fifty-five <i>negros cimarrones</i>, or maroons in English sources. 
I will call this interrelated group of men, women, and children "House Don Luis"

## Tierra Firme in the 16th Century
The Spanish called this section of their mainland Caribbean colonies "Tierra Firme," meaning "Solid Ground." The isthmus of Panama was a critical crossing point between the Atlantic and Pacific for goods, information, and people. How did that work?

## What's in a name?

How much can these names tell us? 
This element is an image now as a placeholder. Might be a better demonstration of the capacity to use a map element with geo-json layers.
